1181,,,,,,,,,The City is Officially Chartered,"<p> Though the area had been inhabited for thousands of years, San Sebastián was first chartered in 1181 by King Sancho VI of Navarre. </p> <p> This was done by the ruling monarchy to encourage emigration to the area, while also promoting the growth of local industry, primarily fishing. </p>",https://nabarralde.eus/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sancho_vi.jpg,Wikimedia Commons,King Sancho VI of Navarre,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mota_Castle_%28San_Sebastian%29#/media/File:Braun_Donostia-San_Sebastián_UBHD.jpg,
1520,,,,1924,,,,,The Coastline is Heavily Fortified,"<p><b>Though there existed a humble castle atop Mount Urgull since the late 1100s around when the city was officially chartered,</b> by the 1500s it was in a sorry state and was unlikely to be useful defensively. Because of this, King Charles the 5th mandated its restoration and upgrade, through several projects that spanned from 1520 and continued throughout the rest of the 16th century.</p> <p><b>The mount continued to be fortified sporadically for the next 400 years,</b> until it was sold to the city and demilitarized in 1924. Though no longer operational, <i>Castillo de la Mota</i> is now a public park.</p>                           <p><b>Many other coastal fortification besides those on Mount Urgull have been built along the coastline of San Sebastian,</b> with one in nearby Zarautz, and one on Mount Ulia, named the Monpas Battery (which we covered in a  <a href=""http://deustokom-lab.deusto.es/blog/?p=5507&lang=en"">previous feature story</a>).</p>",https://www.freewalkingtoursansebastian.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/munoa7.jpg,Free Walking Tour San Sebastián ,,,,,,

1915,,,,,,,,,The Zurriola Bridge was Constructed,"<p> This beautiful landmark was built to cross the river Urumea into Gros; it was named Kursaal Bridge due to its proximity to the former Kursaal Palace. </p> <p> This bridge was a classic-style metal structure, with a very early 20th-century aesthetic. </p> <p> It was essential for the city's development, as it connected an area of urban expansion with the tourist and commercial heart of Donostia. </p>",https://s1.ppllstatics.com/diariovasco/www/multimedia/202108/08/media/cortadas/zurriola1-kIWD-U150174533492rdC-1968x1216@Diario%20Vasco.jpg,El Diario Vasco,,,,,,
1929,,,,,,,,,The design of the nautical club,"<p> The Real Club Náutico de San Sebastián, founded in 1896, is an emblematic institution of Donostia and one of the oldest nautical clubs in Spain. </p> <p> The club's current building, designed by architects José Manuel Aizpurua and Joaquín Labayen between 1928-1929.

1950,11,19,,,,,,,The inauguration of the statue Sagrado Corazón,"<p> It is located at the top of Mount Urgull, and was designed by the sculptor Federico Coullaut-Valera and the architect Pedro Muguruza. </p> <p>The monument has been the subject of debate due to its post-war origins and its links to the Franco regime. However, for many, it represents an expression of the religious devotion of a significant portion of the population at the time. </p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Colocaci%C3%B3n_de_la_estatua_del_Sagrado_Coraz%C3%B3n_en_el_monte_Urgull_%284_de_8%29_-_Fondo_Mar%C3%ADn-Kutxa_Fototeka.jpg,Wikimedia Commons,,,,,,
1976,,,,,,,,,The Creation of The Comb of The Wind,"<p> The collection of these three beautiful sculptures by Eduardo Chillida, were arranged by the Basque architect Luis Peña Ganchegui. They are one of the most celebrated sculptures in Basque Country. You can find this work of art at the end of La Concha Bay, perhaps on your way to visit the Funicular. </p> <p> The large steel structures are placed among the rocks along the coast, their served shapes and holes allow for wind and waves to flow through them. This creates a beautiful spectacle, both visually and sonically as the wind flows through. </p>","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Peine+del+viento+XV+(Eduardo+Chillida,+1976)/@43.3217181,-2.0056087,18.79z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0xd51baa323e73c31:0xde7a4ad4ef9f450a!8m2!3d43.3218056!4d-2.0053891!16s%2Fg%2F1238y1zn?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D",,,,,,,
1994,,,,,,,,,The restoration of Zurriola,"<p> In the 19th century, Zurriola was known for its large sandbanks. However there was not much use for the beach due to the violent nature of the water. </p> <p>In 1994 local authorities took action to make the beach safer and easier to access. One of the key changes made was the implementation of a breakwater, which increased the length of the beach and subsequently calmed the waters enough to allow swimming. Zurriola is now a surfing hotspot as well as a bustling beach full of activity,  as tourists and locals alike enjoy the benefits of the restoration project. </p>",https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2386378116300184-gr2.jpg,Science Direct,Model of Zurriola restoration plan,,,,,

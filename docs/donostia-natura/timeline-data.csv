1520,,,,1921,,,,,The Coastline is Heavily Fortified,"<p>Though there existed a humble castle atop Mount Urgull since the late 1100s around when the city was officially chartered, by the 1500s it was in a sorry state and was unlikely to be useful defensively. Because of this, King Charles the 5th mandated its restoration and upgrade, through several projects that spanned from 1520 and continued throughout the rest of the 16th century. The mount continued to be fortified sporadically for the next 400 years, until it was sold to the city and demilitarized in 1921.</p> <p>",https://www.freewalkingtoursansebastian.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/munoa7.jpg,Free Walking Tour San Sebastián ,,,,,,

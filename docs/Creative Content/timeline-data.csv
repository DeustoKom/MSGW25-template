To promote the growth of the settlement, the king granted it a <em>fuero</em>—a municipal charter—which provided legal and economic privileges to attract settlers, merchants, and artisans. <p>This charter encouraged trade and maritime activity, laying the foundations for San Sebastián's development as an important port city. <p>The granting of the <em>fuero</em> is documented in historical sources such as the works of historian José María Jimeno Jurío and records preserved in the Basque archives (<a href=""https://www.euskadi.eus/contenidos/informacion/historia_territorio/eu_15750/historia_territorio.html"" target=""_blank"">Euskadi Official History Portal</a>). <p>Over the centuries, San Sebastián evolved under varying sovereignties, but its initial establishment by King Sancho VI marked a critical step in its urban and economic growth.</p>",,Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia,Foundation of Donostia,,text,,https://s1.ppllstatics.com/diariovasco/www/multimedia/201912/01/media/cortadas/ss-maqueta-kwDH-U90841447539mJG-1968x1216@Diario%20Vasco.jpg,

1936,7,17,,1939,4,1,,,Spanish Civil War,"<p> San Sebastián initially fell under Republican control, but was soon taken by Francoist troops. It started years of political repression. After the Spanish Civil War, It started a 40 years dictatorship, under Francisco Franco's control. Among other prohibitions, he imposed a ban on teaching languages ​​from other territories of the State other than Spanish. Thus, during the 40 years of the dictatorship, speaking Basque was prohibited, and even more so, teaching classes in it.</p> </div>  <p> Although repression continued unabated during the final years of the dictatorship, some <strong><em>Ikastolas</em></strong> were legalized and allowed to teach Basque. Specifically, in San Sebastián, the first <strong><em>Ikastola</em></strong> was established in 1970. However, during the dictatorship, speaking Basque was completely prohibited, and during the final years (including the final days) of the Franco regime, <strong>repression against movements defending the identity of Basque culture was total.</strong> <p> The person who most worked on the creation of <strong><em>Ikastolas</em></strong> in clandestinity was <strong>Elbira Zipitria</strong>. Elbira Zipitria (1906–1982) was a pioneering Basque educator whose innovative approach to teaching the Basque language laid the foundation for the <strong><em>IIkastola</em></strong> movement during Francoist Spain. <p> In a period when the Basque language was repressed, Zipitria organized clandestine Ikastolas—Basque-language schools—that became crucial for preserving and revitalizing Euskara. Her dedication not only safeguarded the language but also inspired a broader cultural revival in the Basque Country. <p> Official institutions such as <a href=""https://www.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/es/publicaciones/elbira-zipitria-irastorza/art-15186/#"" target=""_blank"">Eusko Ikaskuntza</a> recognize her pivotal role in the educational and cultural history of the Basque people.</p>",https://humanidades.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/guerra-civil-española-1-e1587167846128-800x400.jpg,<strong>ENCICLOPEDIA HUMANIDADES</strong>,Image of Republican citizens being taken to be shot by soldiers from the Francoist side,,text,,,

Despite its ambition, the event faced significant issues: organizational problems, jury disagreements, and rule violations, such as screening films without subtitles and awarding previously released movies. <p>These controversies led the FIAPF (International Federation of Film Producers Association) to withdraw its official recognition, <strong>marking a challenging moment in the festival's history.</strong> According to the <a href=""https://www.sansebastianfestival.com/archivo/1/36/es"" target=""_blank"">Official San Sebastián Festival history</a>, these difficulties almost jeopardized the festival’s future.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/es.h-cdn.co/fotoes/images/media/imagenes/festivales/san-sebastian/2012/60-anos-en-12-imagenes/03_audrey_1964/5823332-1-esl-ES/03_audrey_1964.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9307737056428157xh;center,top&resize=980:*",<strong>Wikipedia</strong>,Audrey Hepburn in San Sebastián's International Film Festival,,text,,https://s2.ppllstatics.com/diariovasco/www/pre2017/multimedia/noticias/201608/25/media/foto-primera-edicion-kpMG-U202475171464jME-575x323@Diario%20Vasco.jpg,

1969,,,,2011,,,,,Basque Nationalism and ETA activity,"<p> During this decade, the city experienced the tensions of Basque separatism and acts of violence tied to ETA during Spain's transition to democracy. ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna), founded in 1959 by young Basque nationalists, including key figures like the Etxebarrieta brothers, emerged as a response to the Franco regime’s brutal repression of Basque cultural and political identity <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/ETA"" target=""_blank"">(Britannica, n.d.)</a>. <p>Initially a cultural movement within the group EKIN, ETA soon evolved into a paramilitary organization advocating for Basque independence through armed struggle. Under Franco, its actions were seen by some as resistance; however, its first fatal attack came in 1968, when Txabi Etxebarrieta killed a Guardia Civil officer—shortly before being shot dead himself, becoming a martyr within the organization. <p>Following the dictator’s death in 1975, Spain transitioned to democracy, legalizing political parties and granting the Basque Country substantial autonomy through the 1979 Statute of Autonomy. Despite this, ETA continued its violent campaign, arguing that true independence had not been achieved and that the democratic state was a continuation of the centralist oppression</p>",https://www.sabinoarana.eus/storage/story-event/es/default/la-primera-manifestacion-multitudinaria-contra-eta-1.jpg?1667199809,<strong>The first manifestation against ETA </strong>,The first public manifestation against ETA,,text,,,black
1975,6,,,2001,,,,,<strong>State Terrorism.</strong>Dirty War Against ETA,"<p> While ETA's campaign of violence dominated headlines for decades, Spain's fight against Basque separatism also included serious abuses by state forces, particularly during the 1980s. One of the most controversial episodes was the emergence of state-sponsored terrorism, exemplified by groups like the GAL (<em>Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación</em>) and the Batallón Vasco Español, which operated as clandestine death squads. <p> These groups, supported or tolerated by sectors of the Spanish state, were responsible for kidnappings, torture, and assassinations of alleged ETA members and sympathizers, often without due process. One of the darkest symbols of this era is the case of Mikel Zabalza, a young bus driver from Navarre who was arrested by the Guardia Civil in 1985 and taken to the Intxaurrondo barracks in San Sebastián, a site notoriously linked to torture. <p>Zabalza was accused of ETA connections but died under interrogation; authorities initially claimed he had escaped and drowned, but his body was found weeks later in the Bidasoa River, showing signs consistent with torture. Lots of protests were convened by people from Orbaizeta (hometown of Zabalza), and also from Donostia, where Zabalza worked as a bus driver <a href=""https://elpais.com/diario/1985/12/23/portada/504140404_850215.html"" target=""_blank"">(El País, 1985)</a>. </p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Mikel-Zabalza-frontal.jpg,<strong>Wikipedia</strong>,"A picture of Mikel Zabalza, tortured at Intxaurrondo.",,,,,

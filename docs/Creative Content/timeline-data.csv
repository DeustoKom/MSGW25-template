1969,,,,2011,,,,,Basque Nationalism and ETA activity,"<p> During this decade, the city experienced the tensions of Basque separatism and acts of violence tied to ETA during Spain's transition to democracy. ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna), founded in 1959 by young Basque nationalists, including key figures like the Etxebarrieta brothers, emerged as a response to the Franco regime’s brutal repression of Basque cultural and political identity (Britannica). Initially a cultural movement within the group EKIN, ETA soon evolved into a paramilitary organization advocating for Basque independence through armed struggle. Under Franco, its actions were seen by some as resistance; however, its first fatal attack came in 1968, when Txabi Etxebarrieta killed a Guardia Civil officer—shortly before being shot dead himself, becoming a martyr within the organization (El País). Following the dictator’s death in 1975, Spain transitioned to democracy, legalizing political parties and granting the Basque Country substantial autonomy through the 1979 Statute of Autonomy. Despite this, ETA continued its violent campaign, arguing that true independence had not been achieved and that the democratic state was a continuation of the centralist oppression</p>",https://www.sabinoarana.eus/storage/story-event/es/default/la-primera-manifestacion-multitudinaria-contra-eta-1.jpg?1667199809,<strong>The first manifestation against ETA </strong>,The first public manifestation against ETA,,text,,,black
1975,6,,,2001,,,,,<strong>State Terrorism.</strong>Dirty War Against ETA,"<p> While ETA's campaign of violence dominated headlines for decades, Spain's fight against Basque separatism also included serious abuses by state forces, particularly during the 1980s. One of the most controversial episodes was the emergence of state-sponsored terrorism, exemplified by groups like the GAL (Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación) and the Batallón Vasco Español, which operated as clandestine death squads. <p> These groups, supported or tolerated by sectors of the Spanish state, were responsible for kidnappings, torture, and assassinations of alleged ETA members and sympathizers, often without due process. One of the darkest symbols of this era is the case of Mikel Zabalza, a young bus driver from Navarre who was arrested by the Guardia Civil in 1985 and taken to the Intxaurrondo barracks in San Sebastián, a site notoriously linked to torture. <p>Zabalza was accused of ETA connections but died under interrogation; authorities initially claimed he had escaped and drowned, but his body was found weeks later in the Bidasoa River, showing signs consistent with torture.</p>",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Mikel-Zabalza-frontal.jpg,<strong>Wikipedia</strong>,"A picture of Mikel Zabalza, tortured at Intxaurrondo.",,,,,

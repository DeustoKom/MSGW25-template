Social media has <strong>profoundly transformed</strong> how young people interact, communicate, and form relationships. These platforms open up <em>unprecedented opportunities</em> to connect, discover communities, and express creativity in meaningful ways.

  <dd>Psychological effects commonly experienced by young users.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Feelings of Inadequacy</strong></dt>
